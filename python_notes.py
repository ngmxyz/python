##### While loops

 # 1
 # 2
 # 3
 # 4

##### Guessing game

##### car game

##### For loop

prices = [10, 20, 30]
total = 0

for price in prices:
    total += price
print(f"Total: {total}")

# this adds all the prices together

##### Nested loops

numbers = [1, 1, 1, 1, 9]
for x_count in numbers:
    output = ''
    for count in range(x_count):
        output += 'x'

# prints an L shape of x's

##### largest number find using for loop and lists

most_moral = moral_scores[0]

for how_moral in moral_scores:
    if how_moral > most_moral:
        most_moral = how_moral
print(how_moral)

# this would print 10 because 10 is the highest moral_score

##### 2d lists

matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]

for row in matrix:
    for item in row:
        print(item)


##### search in index

words = ["pizza", "chips", "cookies", "bread", "beer"]
print(("pizza" or "poison") in words)
# would return true because pizza is in there

##### append and copy in list

numbers = [5, 2, 1, 5, 7, 4]
numbers2 = numbers.copy()
numbers.append(10)
print(numbers)
print(numbers2)

# prints
# [5, 2, 1, 5, 7, 4, 10]
# [5, 2, 1, 5, 7, 4]

##### remove duplicates in a list

numbers = [2, 2, 4, 6, 3, 4, 6, 1]
uniques = []
for number in numbers:
    if number not in uniques:
        uniques.append(number)
print(uniques)

###### unpacking

coordinates = [1, 2, 3]

x, y, z = coordinates
# ^that^ does the same as below
x = coordinates[0]
y = coordinates[1]
z = coordinates[2]

##### dictionary

customer = {
    "name": "John Smith",
    "age": 30,
    "is_verified": True
}
customer["birthdate"] = "Jan 1 1980"
print(customer["birthdate"])
print(customer["name"])
# prints Jan 1 1980
# prints John Smith

##### Moral game v1

command = ""
immoral_values = ["stealing", "stole", "lying", "lied", "hurt", "cheat"]
moral_values = ["help", "give", "love", "charity", "build"]
input_prompt = input("What happened?: ")
word_list = input_prompt.split()
moral_weight = 0

for word in word_list:
    if word.lower() in immoral_values:
        moral_weight += -1
    elif word.lower() in moral_values:
        moral_weight += 1
    else:
        moral_weight += 0
print(f"Moral Score: {moral_weight}")

# "I love you" would have a moral score of 1, "I hate you" would be -1, and "I hate and love you" as 0"

### dictionary split for and get method

message = input("> ")
words = message.split(' ')
emojis = {
    ":)": "üòÅ",
    ":(": "‚òπÔ∏è"
}
output = ""
for word in words:
    output += emojis.get(word, word) + " "
print(output)
# entering "hello :( :)" would print hello (frown emoji) (happy emoji)
